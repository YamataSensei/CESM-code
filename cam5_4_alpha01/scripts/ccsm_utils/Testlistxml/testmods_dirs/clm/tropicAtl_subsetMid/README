This testmods directory is meant to be used in conjunction with a 20th
century transient case at resolution 1x1_tropicAtl. 

This starts the simulation in the middle of the dataset, in order to
test the logic for starting in the middle of the landuse_timeseries file.

NOTE: The flanduse_timeseries path is currently set up to be yellowstone-specific,
due to a limitation in CLM's build-namelist. Erik is adding
functionality to build-namelist to allow putting $DIN_LOC_ROOT in the
flanduse_timeseries variable; once that's done, the user_nl_clm file can be made
machine-agnostic.
